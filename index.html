					<h2>Python</h2>
					<p>My first real dive into programming started with Python. I didn't know that I'd end up really enjoying the logical thinking and problem solving that comes with programming when I started learning it. In fact, I took the class that taught me Python to fill an elective! The puzzle solving elements of programming mixed with the ease of learning and reading simple Python code immediately resonated with me. I still love Python and how it feels like it can be molded to fit almost any situation if you try hard enough. Also, being named after Monty Python is almost always a ++!</p>

					<a name="ada"></a>
					<h2>Ada</h2>
					<p>If Python is the reason I grew so fond of programming, Ada is the reason I almost ran far, far away and never returned. Named after the super boss female mathematician Ada Lovelace, Ada is a <em><b>very</b></em> strickly typed language. Coming off of learning python, this meant if I made one tiny mistake in my code while I was learning it, I was likely to be searching for that mistake for hours. Also, I honestly can't remember, but I'm pretty sure that anytime you try to use a random function in Ada, the word random has to be capitalized. This quirk has ruined me for life. Every time I type Math.random() I accidentally capitalize random the first time. Every. Time.</p>

					<a name="java"></a>
					<h2>Java</h2>
					<p>I learned Java alongside being hammered with lots of programming concepts and terms that I hadn't heard of before. That along with some of the more strongly typed aspects of Java and trying to convert my mind from Ada to Java left a bad taste in my mouth. My entire time with Java, I wished I was learning C++ thanks to things I had heard from my friends about it being a better language. In hindsight, they're not all too different in my memory and I was probably being too hard on Java. I look forward to re-learing Java with a more open mindset in the near future!</p>

				<section>
					<a name="c++"></a>
					<h2>C++</h2>
					<p>When I learned C++ I was also, coincidentally, in classes that had me dabbling in C and C#, both of with I truly remember very little about. Likewise, I remember very little of C++. I remember I was happy to be done with Java, and I really missed Python at this point. I know it was the first time I had to really worry about memory leaks, which was a scary concept at the time. In the end, I know I transitioned to and from C++ pretty smoothly but I don't hold any fond memories for or grudges against C++.</p>

					<a name="mysql"></a>
					<h2>MySQL</h2>
					<p>When I took a class on database systems, I really had no idea what I was getting into. After a few weeks of being really confused of what I was being taught, and finally diving into MySQL, I realized I was basically doing boolean algebra in action. I had been exposed to a lot of Math logic, truth tables, grammars, and other similar concepts so when I finally got to work with MySQL after a few weeks of lectures, it all clicked. MySQL suddenly seemed easy, and sometimes kind of fun! The course didn't go too far beyond building a sample, small database so I never got into the higher level concepts usually assocatied with Database management. As a result, my memory of MySQL is that its a surprisingly logical and well behaved language. I live in fear of the day my memory may be proven wrong. </p>

					<h2>Japanese!</h2>
					<p>Okay, so Japanese isn't a programming language, but I never explicitly implied this list was limited to digital languages! I only strongly implied it! That said, I've been learning Japanese for the past month or so on the app Duolingo. I think it's going pretty well so far, even if I am having a little trouble with the kanji. I downloaded a Japanese Google keyboard for my phone, and I can type out some very basic conversational phrases to my friends. I've also learned that the Japanese keyboard's autocorrect is vastly superior to my english keyboard's autocorrect! Overall, so far, I'm really enjoying Japanese!</p>
